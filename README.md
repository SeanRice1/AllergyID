# FoodAllergyScanner
An Android app to help people with food allergies 

This is an android app with an easy-to-understand interface to help alert people of whether the food item they have contains something they are allergic to via scanning a UPC barcode. The goal of this project is to help people who may have trouble reading food packaging labels such as small children or elderly people.

Note: this is still in development, and should not be used by the public.
