# FoodAllergyScanner
An Android app to help people with food allergies 

This will be an android app with an easy-to-understand interface to help alert people whether the food item they have contains something they are allergic to via scanning a UPC barcode. The goal is to help people who may have trouble reading food packaging labels such as small children.
